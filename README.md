# Dan Schielke - Public Code Profile

Welcome! This is a collection of code that I am free to post without legal ramifications. 

The vast majority of code I wrote for the last several years has been for coursework or my day job. Anything I can release publicly will be made available here. Content will mostly consist of scripts created for data competitions.

If you find something interesting or have a question about something I did, send an e-mail to danschielke@gmail.com.
